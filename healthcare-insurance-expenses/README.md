## Overview

This GitHub repository contains a predictive model for assisting patients in predicting their medical bills for their next hospital visit. The model is built using a dataset provided by the insurance firm responsible for the patients. The dataset includes information about the patients' age, sex, body mass index (BMI), region, hospital charges, smoking status, and the number of children each patient has.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided by [InsuranceFirmName]. It includes the following features:

- **Age**: The age of the patient.
- **Sex**: The gender of the patient (e.g., male or female).
- **BMI**: The Body Mass Index of the patient.
- **Region**: The region of the patient.
- **Charges**: The medical charges incurred by the patient.
- **Smoker**: Whether the patient is a smoker or a non-smoker.
- **Children**: The number of children each patient has.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset file(s).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models.
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts for data processing and model evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies.
- `README.md`: This document, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-insurance-predictive-model.git

2. Navigate to the project's directory

    ```bash
    cd healthcare-insurance-predictive-model

3. Create a virtual environment and install all the packages

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the notebooks folder and run the desired notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory.

## Usage
You can use this predictive model to estimate medical bills for your next hospital visit by providing the necessary input data. Instructions for using the model can be found in the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
