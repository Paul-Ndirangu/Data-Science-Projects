## Introduction

This repository is meant to showcase a variety of data science projects, ranging from exploratory data analysis to advanced machine learning models. Each project is organized in its own directory and includes all necessary code, data, and documentation.

## Project List

1. [Car Price Prediction](./car_price_prediction/): Prediction of car prices.

2. [Healthcare Insurance Expences](./healthcare-insurance-expenses/): Expences of health

3. [Electricity Price Prediction](): Electricity Price Prediction

<!-- 1. [Customer Segmentation](./customer_segmentation): An analysis of customer data to identify distinct customer segments using clustering algorithms.
   
2. [Sentiment Analysis](./sentiment_analysis): Analyzing text data to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using natural language processing techniques.

3. [Predictive Maintenance](./predictive_maintenance): A predictive maintenance model using machine learning to anticipate equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.

4. [Image Classification](./image_classification): Using deep learning models to classify images into predefined categories.

5. [Computer Vision](./computer_vision): Using deep learning models to build computer vision models. -->
